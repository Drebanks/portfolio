          <p>
            As the largest cryptocurrency and digital exchange platform in
            Nigeria, Patricia provides healthcare services to over 989.000
            people annually. Patricia is built on the idea that faster and
            easier people are able to access essential digital services, the
            better their quality of life. MyPatricia is a mobile platform that
            provides a crypto wallet for its users to store their electronic
            funds safely and swiftly. It ensures a high standard of safety and
            security to support trading in popular coins such as Bitcoin.
            Etherum and Litecoin. The challenge was to revamp the MyPatricia web
            and mobile app to be seamlessly integrated into a users’s trading
            journey. With that challenge, I collaborated with other stakeholders
            and we dived into the future of crypto-exchange, creating a future
            proof structure that allows (digital) trading innovation.

            Every good project starts with a good plan. I started with applying
            design thinking as a problem-solving method throughout the UX
            process. ..

            Together with users and specialists of medical processes we
            empathised with the patients and immersed ourselves in their needs.
            We mapped a healthcare journey, which starts way before patients are
            checking-in into a hospital and ends a few steps after the medical
            appointment is over. It allowed us to clearly identify the
            opportunity areas to improve patients’ experience at CUF hospitals.
            In 5 UX sprints we redesigned the complete MyCUF app with which we
            want to contribute to the improvement of lives of 989.000 patients
            every year.
          </p>
          <h1>Uncovering the user needs</h1>
          <p>
            Trading cryptocurrency has always been the dream and goal of
            numerous businesses and individuals. However, a major blocker is
            gaining an understanding of the market, coins and navigating through
            a crypto exchange application seamlessly. Before imagining the first
            screen or even a button of the new MyPatricia app, we deeply
            immersed ourselves into the user’s experience. Not an easy task,
            considering that it can be a very emotional and many times
            physically painful experience, not only for the patients but also to
            their closed ones. To help the case, due to COVID-19 lockdown we
            approached this project in a fully remote way.
            <br />
            <br />
            To effectively design a medium that simplifies the exchange process,
            we interviewed three different user groups; Group A consisted of
            experienced crypto traders who are familiar with other crypto apps
            and the crypto universe. Meanwhile, Group B consisted of regular
            crypto wallet users, and Group C consisted of non-traders and
            potential traders.
            <br />
            <br />
            We started with getting the user’s demographics to be sure they fit
            into my target audience. Asked questions about their experience
            using exchange wallets, using cryptocurrencies, what they know about
            blockchain technology, the blockers/issues they face using wallets,
            how they think it can be improved, what doesn’t work for them, what
            motivates them to keep using the wallet, etc.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            In the information-gathering phase, I used card sorting to map out
            and understand the challenges of each user group. After conducting
            several in-depth interviews with a quite diverse group of users and
            analysing the homework in the form of context mapping exercises,
            some patterns started to emerge. We analysed all insights in order
            to build a current customer journey of the patients visit to a
            (private) hospital, the journey which extends beyond the appointment
            itself

            When I was done with all my interviews, I compiled it into a UX
            audit and had a meeting with the Printivo team, we went over all the
            data and decided on goals for the redesign/rebuild that will help us
            increase platform value, grow the customer base and increase
            conversion and reduce bounce rate. Put simply we planned to:

            The next step is to test the prototype. As they say at Stanford’s
            d.school: “Prototype as if you know you’re right, but test as if you
            know you’re wrong. We would test the prototype to:
          </p>
          <ul className={classes.list}>
            <li>Identify any potential confusion in navigation</li>
            <li>Validate the existing feature set and navigation</li>
            <li>Gather insight about the current layout</li>
            <li>Possibly eliminate excessive content</li>
            <li>Refine the POV</li>
            <li>
              Learn more about cryptocurrency and its users, and make the next
              iteration of the product better.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h1>The Outcome of the project.</h1>
          <p>
            In the end we had a blast working together on this revamp to create
            the new digital experience for our users. A couple of our end
            results are:
          </p>
          <ul className={classes.list}>
            <li>
              The new redesign created a modern and easy-to-use platform across
              web and mobile.
            </li>
            <li>
              We decreased the drop-out rate and had an increase of 13% in
              customer satisfation{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Users are able to experience their whole crypto trading journey
              from out of their pockets or at their desktops at home.
            </li>
            <li>We adapted a customer-centric way of working.</li>
